# Detailed Comments on the Code

## Defining Symbols:

```python
t = sp.symbols('t')
```
This defines `t` as a symbolic variable for time, enabling symbolic differentiation and other operations with respect to time.

---

## Magnitude Function:

```python
def magnitude(vector):
    return sp.sqrt(sum([component**2 for component in vector]))
```
This function calculates the magnitude (or length) of a vector using the Pythagorean theorem. It squares each component, sums them, and takes the square root.

---

## Directional Cosines:

```python
def directional_cosines(vector):
    mag = magnitude(vector)
    if mag != 0:
        return [component / mag for component in vector]
    else:
        return [0, 0, 0]
```
This function calculates the directional cosines of a vector by dividing each component by the vector's magnitude. If the magnitude is zero, it returns zero cosines.

---

## Angle from Cosine:

```python
def angle_from_cosine(cosine_value):
    if cosine_value >= -1 and cosine_value <= 1:
        angle_rad = sp.acos(cosine_value)
        angle_deg = sp.deg(angle_rad)
        return angle_deg
    else:
        return None
```
This function calculates the angle (in degrees) corresponding to a given cosine value. It ensures the cosine value is within the valid range (-1 to 1).

---

## Vector Input Type:

```python
def get_vector_type():
    print("Please choose the type of vector you are entering:")
    print("1. Position Vector")
    print("2. Velocity Vector")
    print("3. Acceleration Vector")
    vector_type = int(input("Enter 1, 2, or 3: "))
    return vector_type
```
This function prompts the user to specify the type of vector (position, velocity, or acceleration) they want to input.

---

## Getting Vector Components:

```python
def get_vector_components(vector_type):
    t = sp.symbols('t')
    if vector_type == 1:
        print("Enter the components of the position vector:")
    elif vector_type == 2:
        print("Enter the components of the velocity vector:")
    elif vector_type == 3:
        print("Enter the components of the acceleration vector:")
    i_component = input("Enter the i-component (can be a function of t): ")
    j_component = input("Enter the j-component (can be a function of t): ")
    k_component = input("Enter the k-component (can be a function of t): ")
    i_expr = sp.sympify(i_component)
    j_expr = sp.sympify(j_component)
    k_expr = sp.sympify(k_component)
    vector = sp.Matrix([i_expr, j_expr, k_expr])
    return vector
```
This function gathers the components of the chosen vector type from the user. It converts the input into SymPy expressions for further calculations.

---

## Velocity and Acceleration Computation:

### Compute Velocity:

```python
def compute_velocity(position_vector, t):
    velocity = sp.diff(position_vector, t)
    return velocity
```
This function computes the velocity vector by differentiating the position vector with respect to time.

### Compute Acceleration:

```python
def compute_acceleration(velocity_vector, t):
    acceleration = sp.diff(velocity_vector, t)
    return acceleration
```
This function computes the acceleration vector by differentiating the velocity vector with respect to time.

---

## Integrating Vectors:

```python
def integrate_vector(vector, t, initial_conditions):
    integrated_vector = sp.integrate(vector, t) + initial_conditions
    return integrated_vector
```
This function integrates a vector with respect to time and adds initial conditions to calculate the resulting vector.

---

## Initial Conditions:

### Position:

```python
def get_initial_conditions_for_position():
    x0 = float(input("Enter the initial x-position: "))
    y0 = float(input("Enter the initial y-position: "))
    z0 = float(input("Enter the initial z-position: "))
    return sp.Matrix([x0, y0, z0])
```
This function collects initial position conditions for all three axes.

### Velocity:

```python
def get_initial_conditions_for_velocity():
    v0x = float(input("Enter the initial x-velocity: "))
    v0y = float(input("Enter the initial y-velocity: "))
    v0z = float(input("Enter the initial z-velocity: "))
    return sp.Matrix([v0x, v0y, v0z])
```
This function collects initial velocity conditions for all three axes.

---

## Main Functionality:

### Handling Velocity Vector:

```python
if vector_type == 2:
    initial_position = get_initial_conditions_for_position()
    position_vector = integrate_vector(vector, t, initial_position)
    acceleration_vector = compute_acceleration(vector, t)
```
If the user provides a velocity vector, this block integrates it to find the position vector and computes the acceleration vector.

### Handling Acceleration Vector:

```python
elif vector_type == 3:
    initial_velocity = get_initial_conditions_for_velocity()
    initial_position = get_initial_conditions_for_position()
    velocity_vector_integrated = integrate_vector(vector, t, initial_velocity)
    position_vector_integrated = integrate_vector(velocity_vector_integrated, t, initial_position)
```
If the user provides an acceleration vector, this block integrates it twice to find the velocity and position vectors.

---

## Evaluating Vectors:

### Specific Time:

```python
if choice == "time":
    time_value = get_time_value()
    position_at_time = position_vector.subs(t, time_value)
    velocity_at_time = vector.subs(t, time_value)
    acceleration_at_time = acceleration_vector.subs(t, time_value)
```
This block evaluates the position, velocity, and acceleration vectors at a specific time value.

### Displacement:

```python
elif choice == "displacement":
    start_time, end_time = get_time_interval()
    position_at_start = position_vector.subs(t, start_time)
    position_at_end = position_vector.subs(t, end_time)
    displacement = position_at_end - position_at_start
```
This block calculates displacement by evaluating the position vector at the start and end times and finding the difference.

---

## Call the Main Function:

```python
main()
```
This calls the main function, starting the process and prompting the user for inputs.
